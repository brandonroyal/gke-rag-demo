It allows you to specify the desired state of the deployment, including the number of replicas, the desired CPU and memory resources, and the container image to use. Kubernetes will then automatically manage the deployment, scaling it up or down as needed to meet the desired state. Deployments also provide rolling updates, which means that new versions of the pods are introduced gradually, with each new version replacing one of the old ones. This ensures that the application remains available during the update process.'"
